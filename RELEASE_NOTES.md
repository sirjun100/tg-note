## 2026-03-10 — Hotfixes (post Sprint 19)

### Bug Fixes
- **DEF-030 re-fix: Stoic note timestamp LLM path** — The Sprint 19 fix only corrected the rule-based formatter. The LLM path (`_format_stoic_reflection_impl`) still called `datetime.now()` (UTC on server). Fixed by computing `ts` in `stoic.py` with `get_user_timezone_aware_now()` and passing it into the LLM formatter. Evening/morning section headers now always show local time.
- **/tasks command registered** — `/tasks` (plural) was silently ignored — no handler was registered. Now aliases to `/tasks_list` (show pending Google Tasks).

### Planning
- **Sprint 20 planned** — GTD Dashboard (`/tasks_status` cockpit, US-059), World-Class Project Report (`/project_report`, US-060), Google Tasks duplicate check (US-055, deferred from Sprint 19), conversational intent stretch (US-058). 20 committed + 5 stretch pts.

## 2026-03-10 (Sprint 19 — Polish & Bug Fixes)

### New Features
- **Voice message support** — Send a voice note or audio file; the bot transcribes it via OpenAI Whisper and routes it through the same pipeline as text messages. Shows transcription before processing. [DEF-032](project-management/backlog/defects/DEF-032-joplin-did-not-process-voice-message-transcription.md)
- **Stoic quick-reply keyboards** — Each stoic journal question now shows a context-aware `ReplyKeyboardMarkup`: 1–5 numeric for energy, emoji mood options for feeling/mood, Yes/No/Skip for yes-no questions, and a Skip button for open-ended questions. Keyboard removed at end of session. [US-053](project-management/backlog/user-stories/US-053-stoic-quick-reply-for-each-answer.md)
- **Note creation shows full folder path** — Success message now displays the complete path (e.g. `📂 Projects / Professional / My Project`) instead of just the folder name. [US-054](project-management/backlog/user-stories/US-054-note-creation-show-full-path-and-auto-sync.md)
- **YouTube & media thumbnails** — YouTube, Vimeo, and Spotify links now silently skip screenshot and use the `og:image` thumbnail instead. No more "Screenshot skipped" warning for media sites. [DEF-033](project-management/backlog/defects/DEF-033-joplin-agent-fails-to-take-screenshot-of-youtube-v.md)

### Bug Fixes
- **DEF-028: Task times in user timezone** — `/tasks_status` and task listings now convert UTC timestamps to the user's configured timezone (e.g. America/Montreal). [DEF-028](project-management/backlog/defects/DEF-028-tasks-status-shows-times-not-in-user-timezone.md)
- **DEF-029: Missing projects in task creation** — Project selection list now finds nested projects (e.g. `Projects/Professional/My Project`) using a structure-based heuristic instead of only direct children. [DEF-029](project-management/backlog/defects/DEF-029-task-creation-project-list-incomplete-missing-projects.md)
- **DEF-030: Stoic streak uses local date** — Streak tracking now uses the user's local date (not UTC), so completing an entry at 11 PM local time correctly counts for that day. [DEF-030](project-management/backlog/defects/DEF-030-stoic-note-timestamp-utc-instead-of-montreal-time.md)
- **DEF-031: Full folder path on note save** — Note creation success message shows the complete Joplin folder path hierarchy. [DEF-031](project-management/backlog/defects/DEF-031-note-creation-should-show-full-path-and-trigger-sync.md)

### Internal
- Documented Joplin folder structure in `project-management/joplin-folder-structure.md`.
- Updated PARA template in `reorg_orchestrator.py`: Resources expanded to 5 items; Archive includes year-based sub-folders.
- Unit tests: voice handler (9 tests), stoic quick replies (15 tests), timezone fix coverage.

## 2026-03-08 (Sprint 17)

### New Features
- **Brain dump modes** — `/braindump quick` (5 min), `/braindump` (standard 15 min), `/braindump thorough` (25 min). Mode preference saved automatically for next session. [US-035](project-management/backlog/user-stories/US-035-world-class-brain-dump.md)
- **Brain dump time/day context** — Each message now carries elapsed time, target, item count, and time-of-day (morning/afternoon/evening) so the LLM can pace the session and adapt its tone.
- **Brain dump session recovery** — Sessions are persisted in SQLite. If idle >30 min, a "session paused — resuming" message greets the user on their next reply.
- **Photo OCR folder quick-reply** — When OCR needs a folder choice, an inline keyboard with top Joplin folders appears. Tap to save; no need to type. [US-045](project-management/backlog/user-stories/US-045-photo-folder-quick-reply.md)
- **Photo OCR retry on transient failures** — Timeout, connection errors, and 5xx responses are retried up to 2× with exponential backoff (permanent errors like 400 Unprocessable are not retried). [US-047](project-management/backlog/user-stories/US-047-photo-ocr-retry-transient.md)
- **/bookmark command** — `/bookmark <url>` fetches the page title and excerpt, creates a note in a Bookmarks folder (auto-created if missing), and confirms with the title. [US-051](project-management/backlog/user-stories/US-051-bookmark-command.md)

### Internal
- `StateManager` now supports a `user_preferences` table (key-value per user). Used for brain dump mode preference; available for future personalization.
- Unit tests: brain dump modes, context injection, session recovery, user prefs, OCRUnprocessableImageError, and transient OCR retry.

## 2026-03-09

### New Features
- **Joplin folder ↔ Google Tasks project sync** — Sync Joplin project folders with Google Tasks: each project folder becomes a parent task; tasks created for that project appear as subtasks. [US-034](project-management/backlog/user-stories/US-034-joplin-google-tasks-project-sync.md)
  - **Commands**: `/tasks_toggle_project_sync`, `/tasks_sync_projects`, `/tasks_reset_project_sync`, `/tasks_set_projects_folder`
  - **Docs**: [Project Sync](docs/for-users/project-sync.md), [Project Sync Troubleshooting](docs/for-users/project-sync-troubleshooting.md)
  - Stalled projects (no next actions) surfaced in daily/weekly reports

### Bug Fixes
- **Recipe image failure feedback** — When image generation fails (screenshot, Gemini, or URL fetch), the bot now logs the reason and alerts the user with the specific cause (e.g. rate limit, API key not set).
- **Recipe folder** — Recipes now save to Resources/🍽️ Recipe first (Ressources fallback for French setups). Previously tried Ressources first.
- **DEF-025: Recipe pasted text** — No longer shows "Screenshot skipped: Security verification required" when user pastes recipe text (URL incidental). Message only shown when user explicitly sent a link. [DEF-025](project-management/backlog/defects/DEF-025-recipe-pasted-text-shows-screenshot-skipped.md)
- **DEF-026: Braindump and photo OCR save failure** — Fixed `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'get'` when saving braindump summaries or photo OCR notes to Joplin. Root cause: `url_context.get()` was called when `url_context` is None (braindump and photo flows). [DEF-026](project-management/backlog/defects/DEF-026-braindump-and-image-ocr-cannot-save-to-joplin.md)
- **DEF-027: Google token expired — clear re-auth message** — When Google OAuth token is expired or revoked, braindump, planning, stoic, and task creation flows now show "🔑 Google token expired or revoked. Use /tasks_connect to re-authenticate." instead of the generic "Check /tasks_status for details." [DEF-027](project-management/backlog/defects/DEF-027-braindump-google-tasks-token-expired.md)

## 2026-03-08

### New Features
- **Command naming** — New canonical names: `tasks_*` (tasks_connect, tasks_status, tasks_config, etc.), `report_*` (report_daily, report_weekly, report_config). Old names kept as aliases.
- **Starred tasks first in reports** — Daily and weekly reports sort tasks with * at start to the top.
- **Report footer commands** — Footers now show `/report_daily`, `/report_weekly`, `/report_config` (updated from deprecated names).
- **Pre-commit hook** — `scripts/pre-commit` runs ruff and mypy before each commit. Install: `cp scripts/pre-commit .git/hooks/pre-commit && chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit`
- **"Who am I" profile query** — Plain messages like "who am i" or "what is my profile" now return your stored profile without routing through the LLM.
- **/bookmark feature request** — FR-051 added for saving URLs to Joplin with metadata and tags. [FR-051](project-management/backlog/features/FR-051-bookmark-command.md)

### Bug Fixes
- **Recipe folder** — All recipes now save to Resources/🍽️ Recipe (or Ressources/🍽️ Recipe). Folder created automatically if missing.
- **Recipe image fallback** — When URL screenshot fails, fall back to LLM-generated image (Gemini) for recipe notes.
- **MCP prepare_gap_check / generate_release_notes** — Scripts now use PROJECT_ROOT when git cwd differs. MCP tools pass env to subprocesses.
- **Weekly report tests** — Fixed timezone-dependent failures: use fixed reference dates and user timezone for assertions.
- **Recipe paywall false positive** — Narrowed paywall detection: "subscribe" alone no longer flags recipe sites with newsletter CTAs. Now requires "subscribe to read/continue/unlock".
- **/recipe command** — New command to explicitly save recipes: paste text or send URL. Forces recipe template for pasted content and paywall fallbacks.
- **Recipe note truncation** — Fixed LLM response truncation when saving long recipes (e.g. carrot cake) that caused JSON parse failure on Fly. Increased max_tokens to 2500 for note generation.
- **Mypy return-value errors** — Fixed `_route_plain_message` exception handlers to return `True` instead of bare `return`.
- **Ruff lint** — Auto-fixed unused imports, import order, and other lint issues across tests.

### Breaking Changes
- (none this release)

### Migration Notes
- Old command names still work as aliases. New names preferred: `/report_daily` instead of `/daily_report`, `/report_config` instead of `/show_report_config`, etc.

## 2026-03-08 — Sprint 18: World-Class Stoic Journal

### New Features
- **Mood & energy check-in** — Before each journaling session, Stoic Journal asks for mood and energy level. Stored in the note as a `## 🔎 Check-in` block. [US-052](project-management/backlog/user-stories/US-052-world-class-stoic-journaling-experience.md) T-001
- **Self-compassion question** — Evening session now includes a dedicated self-compassion prompt (index 4): "If a close friend told you what went wrong today, what would you say?" (Kristin Neff 2003). [US-052](project-management/backlog/user-stories/US-052-world-class-stoic-journaling-experience.md) T-002
- **Question rotation** — All journal questions rotate daily from 3 science-backed variants per slot. Same-day = same questions; new day = fresh perspective. [US-052](project-management/backlog/user-stories/US-052-world-class-stoic-journaling-experience.md) T-003
- **Stoic quote priming** — Daily Stoic quote shown at the start of each session (25 morning / 25 evening), rotating by day ordinal. [US-052](project-management/backlog/user-stories/US-052-world-class-stoic-journaling-experience.md) T-004
- **/stoic review** — Weekly synthesis command: fetches last 7 days of journal entries, calls AI to produce a 150-300 word reflection, saves as `YYYY-WW - Weekly Stoic Review` note. Requires ≥ 3 entries. [US-052](project-management/backlog/user-stories/US-052-world-class-stoic-journaling-experience.md) T-005
- **Streak tracking** — Consecutive daily journaling tracked in `user_preferences`. Resets if a day is skipped. Motivational message shown on save. [US-052](project-management/backlog/user-stories/US-052-world-class-stoic-journaling-experience.md) T-006
- **/stoic_quick** — 2-question shortcut (intention + priority for morning; one win + gratitude for evening). Mode auto-detected by time of day (≥17:00 = evening). Counts toward streak. [US-052](project-management/backlog/user-stories/US-052-world-class-stoic-journaling-experience.md) T-007
- **"What I Learned Today"** — New evening question (index 8): saved as `### 📚 What I Learned Today` section, tagged `#learnings`. [US-042](project-management/backlog/user-stories/US-042-what-i-learned-today.md)
- **/learnings** — Aggregates `📚 What I Learned Today` sections from last 7 Stoic Journal notes into a single digest. [US-042](project-management/backlog/user-stories/US-042-what-i-learned-today.md) T-012
- **"Send as File" tip** — Help text for photo/OCR now includes a tip to use Telegram's "Send as File" for best OCR quality (no compression). [US-050](project-management/backlog/user-stories/US-050-send-as-file-tip.md)

### Bug Fixes
- **Variant rotation slot boundary** — Fixed `_parse_variant_block` to correctly detect slot boundaries: VARIANT_0 after collecting variants now starts a new slot. Previously all consecutive VARIANT_ lines were collapsed into one slot.

### Breaking Changes
- Evening Stoic Journal now has 10 questions (was 8). Sessions saved before this release are unaffected.
- `_get_tomorrow_answer` now reads index 9 only (was index 7 in the 8-question structure).

### Migration Notes
- Quick-mode sessions (`/stoic_quick`) do not include a mood check-in.
- `/stoic review` requires at least 3 journal entries in the past 7 days.
