**Status**: ⏳ In Progress  
**Priority**: 🟡 Medium  
**Story Points**: 13  
**Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Updated**: 2025-01-27  
**Assigned Sprint**: Sprint 3  

## Description

Create comprehensive documentation for the Telegram-Joplin bot project targeting four distinct audiences: programmers (technical implementation), users (how to use the bot), business owners (value proposition and deployment), and LLMs (API specifications and integration guides). Include Mermaid diagrams for workflow visualization.

## User Story

As a stakeholder interested in the project, 
I want clear, targeted documentation for my role, 
so that I can understand, use, or support the system effectively.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Programmer documentation with code architecture, API references, and setup instructions
- [ ] User documentation with installation, configuration, and usage guides
- [ ] Business owner documentation with value proposition, deployment guide, and ROI analysis
- [ ] LLM documentation with API specifications, integration guides, and prompt engineering tips
- [ ] Mermaid workflow diagrams for system architecture and user flows
- [ ] README.md updated with overview and links to detailed docs
- [ ] Documentation hosted in docs/ directory with clear navigation
- [ ] All diagrams rendered correctly in Markdown

## Business Value

Enables faster onboarding of new developers, reduces support queries from users, and helps business stakeholders understand the product's value and deployment requirements. Improves overall project maintainability and adoption.
