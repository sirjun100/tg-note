## Description

Add a comprehensive git commit message template with examples to standardize commit messages across the project. This template will help ensure all commits follow a consistent format that combines business context with technical details, making commit history more meaningful for both business and technical stakeholders.

## User Story

As a developer working on this project, I want a standardized git commit message template, so that all commits follow a consistent format that links to backlog items, clearly describes business value, and provides technical details for other developers.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Git commit message template created (markdown format with guidelines)
- [x] Git commit message template created (text format for direct git integration)
- [x] Git commit message examples document created with multiple scenarios
- [x] Template includes task number format (US-XXX or DEF-XXX)
- [x] Template includes business description section
- [x] Template includes technical changes section
- [x] Template documented in template-catalog.md
- [x] Examples demonstrate proper usage for features, bugs, and small changes
- [x] Changelog updated to reflect new templates

## Business Value

This feature improves project maintainability and traceability by:
- Ensuring all commits link back to backlog items (FR-XXX, BF-XXX)
- Making commit history readable for both business and technical stakeholders
- Providing clear context about what changed and why
- Enabling better project tracking and reporting
- Establishing best practices for the team from the start

## Technical Requirements

- Create `git-commit-template.md` with structured format guidelines
- Create `git-commit-template.txt` for direct git integration (commented format)

- Update `template-catalog.md` to include new template
- Update `changelog.md` to document the addition
- Ensure templates follow existing template structure with metadata headers
- Include validation checklist in template documentation
