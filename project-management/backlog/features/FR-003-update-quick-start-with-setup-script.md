# Feature Request: FR-003 - Update Quick Start Guide to Use Setup Script

**Status**: ⏳ In Progress  
**Priority**: 🟠 High  
**Story Points**: 3 (Fibonacci: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13)  
**Created**: 2026-01-01  
**Updated**: 2025-01-27  
**Assigned Sprint**: Sprint 3

## Description

Update the quick-start.md guide to use the existing `setup-backlog.sh` script instead of manual file copying and directory creation steps. This will simplify the onboarding process for new users and ensure consistency in setup across different projects.

## User Story

As a new user adopting the backlog toolkit, I want the quick start guide to use an automated setup script, so that I can get started quickly without manually copying files and creating directories, reducing setup time and potential errors.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Quick start guide updated to use `setup-backlog.sh` script
- [ ] Manual file copying steps replaced with script execution
- [ ] Manual directory creation steps replaced with script execution
- [ ] Script usage instructions are clear and include examples
- [ ] Guide explains what the script does (creates directories, copies templates, creates initial backlog)
- [ ] Guide includes information about script options (copy templates, copy processes, create backlog)
- [ ] Guide mentions how to customize the script for different project structures
- [ ] Guide maintains information about manual setup as an alternative option
- [ ] All references to manual paths are updated or clarified

## Business Value

This feature improves user onboarding by:
- Reducing setup time from ~5 minutes to ~1 minute
- Eliminating manual errors in file copying and directory creation
- Providing a consistent setup experience across all users
- Making the toolkit more accessible to users less familiar with command-line operations
- Ensuring all users start with the same directory structure and file organization

## Technical Requirements

- Update `quick-start.md` to replace manual steps with script execution
- Reference `scripts/setup-backlog.sh` in the quick start guide
- Include script execution instructions with proper paths
- Explain script options and interactive prompts
- Maintain backward compatibility by keeping manual setup as alternative
- Update any path references that may have changed
- Ensure script is mentioned in the "5-Minute Setup" section

## Reference Documents

- Quick Start Guide: `backlog-toolkit/quick-start.md`
- Setup Script: `backlog-toolkit/scripts/setup-backlog.sh`
- Scripts README: `backlog-toolkit/scripts/README.md`
- Backlog Management Process: `backlog-toolkit/processes/backlog-management-process.md`

## Technical References

- Quick start file: `backlog-toolkit/quick-start.md`
- Setup script: `backlog-toolkit/scripts/setup-backlog.sh`
- Scripts directory: `backlog-toolkit/scripts/`

## Dependencies

- None - The setup script already exists and is functional

## Notes

- The `setup-backlog.sh` script already exists and creates the directory structure, copies templates/processes, and creates the initial product backlog
- The script is interactive and prompts for copying templates, processes, and creating backlog
- The script currently creates structure in `backlog-toolkit/project-management/` but can be adapted for user projects
- Manual setup should remain as an alternative for users who prefer it or need custom structures
- The guide should explain how to adapt the script for different project root directories
