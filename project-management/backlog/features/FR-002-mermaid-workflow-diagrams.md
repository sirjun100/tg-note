# Feature Request: FR-002 - Add Mermaid Workflow Diagrams for Backlog Management

**Status**: ✅ Completed  
**Priority**: 🟠 High  
**Story Points**: 5 (Fibonacci: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13)  
**Created**: 2026-01-01  
**Updated**: 2026-01-01  
**Assigned Sprint**: Sprint 1

## Description

Add Mermaid.js flow diagrams to document and visualize the complete workflow of feature requests and bug fixes from initial creation through backlog management to sprint planning. These diagrams will provide a visual representation of the processes defined in the backlog management process document, making it easier for team members to understand the lifecycle and flow of backlog items.

## User Story

As a team member (developer, product owner, or scrum master), I want visual workflow diagrams using Mermaid.js that show how feature requests and bug fixes flow from creation to sprint planning, so that I can quickly understand the process, identify where items are in the workflow, and ensure proper procedures are followed.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Mermaid flowchart diagram created showing feature request workflow (creation → backlog → refinement → sprint planning)
- [x] Mermaid flowchart diagram created showing bug fix workflow (creation → backlog → immediate action/sprint planning)
- [x] Mermaid state diagram created showing status lifecycle (Not Started → In Progress → Completed)
- [x] Diagrams integrated into backlog management process document
- [x] Diagrams include decision points (e.g., critical bug vs. regular bug)
- [x] Diagrams include all key steps from the process document
- [x] Diagrams are properly formatted and render correctly in markdown viewers
- [x] Diagrams reference relevant sections of the process document
- [x] Example diagrams added to examples folder for reference

## Business Value

This feature improves process understanding and adoption by:
- Providing visual representation of complex workflows
- Making it easier for new team members to understand the process
- Reducing confusion about where items should be in the workflow
- Enabling quick reference during backlog refinement and sprint planning
- Improving process compliance by making steps clear and visible
- Supporting documentation and training efforts

## Technical Requirements

- Use Mermaid.js syntax for flowcharts and state diagrams
- Diagrams must render in common markdown viewers (GitHub, GitLab, VS Code, etc.)
- Include proper node labels and decision points
- Use consistent styling and color coding where applicable
- Diagrams should be embedded in markdown files
- Create separate diagrams for feature requests and bug fixes
- Include status lifecycle diagram
- Reference specific sections of backlog-management-process.md

## Reference Documents

- Backlog Management Process: `backlog-toolkit/processes/backlog-management-process.md`
- Product Backlog Structure: `backlog-toolkit/processes/product-backlog-structure.md`
- Sprint Planning Template: `backlog-toolkit/templates/sprint-planning-template.md`
- Feature Request Template: `backlog-toolkit/templates/feature-request-template.md`
- Bug Fix Template: `backlog-toolkit/templates/bug-fix-template.md`

## Technical References

- Process document: `backlog-toolkit/processes/backlog-management-process.md`
- Examples folder: `backlog-toolkit/examples/`
- Mermaid.js documentation: https://mermaid.js.org/

## Dependencies

- None - This is a documentation enhancement that can be implemented independently

## Notes

- Mermaid.js is widely supported in markdown viewers (GitHub, GitLab, VS Code, etc.)
- Diagrams should complement, not replace, the detailed process documentation
- Consider creating both detailed and simplified versions of diagrams
- Diagrams should be updated if the process changes
- This feature enhances the existing backlog management process documentation

## Proposed Mermaid Diagrams

### Feature Request Workflow
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Create Feature Request] --> B[Use Feature Request Template]
    B --> C[Assign Unique ID FR-XXX]
    C --> D[Fill Required Fields]
    D --> E[Save to features/FR-XXX-name.md]
    E --> F[Add to Product Backlog Table]
    F --> G[Set Status: Not Started]
    G --> H[Assign Priority]
    H --> I[Estimate Story Points]
    I --> J{Backlog Refinement}
    J -->|Clarify Requirements| K[Update Feature Request]
    K --> J
    J -->|Ready for Sprint| L[Select for Sprint Planning]
    L --> M[Add to Sprint Planning Document]
    M --> N[Break Down into Tasks]
    N --> O[Update Status: In Progress]
    O --> P[Work on Feature]
    P --> Q[Complete Feature]
    Q --> R[Update Status: Completed]
    R --> S[Mark Acceptance Criteria Complete]
```

### Bug Fix Workflow
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Create Bug Fix] --> B[Use Bug Fix Template]
    B --> C[Assign Unique ID BF-XXX]
    C --> D[Fill Required Fields]
    D --> E[Document Steps to Reproduce]
    E --> F[Save to bugs/BF-XXX-description.md]
    F --> G[Add to Product Backlog Table]
    G --> H[Set Status: Not Started]
    H --> I[Assign Priority]
    I --> J{Is Critical?}
    J -->|Yes| K[Immediate Action Required]
    K --> L[Add to Current Sprint]
    J -->|No| M[Estimate Story Points]
    M --> N{High Priority?}
    N -->|Yes| O[Address in Next Sprint]
    N -->|No| P[Wait for Sprint Planning]
    O --> Q[Add to Sprint Planning]
    P --> Q
    L --> Q
    Q --> R[Break Down into Tasks]
    R --> S[Update Status: In Progress]
    S --> T[Work on Bug Fix]
    T --> U[Complete Bug Fix]
    U --> V[Update Status: Completed]
    V --> W[Verify Fix]
```

### Status Lifecycle
```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> NotStarted: Item Created
    NotStarted --> InProgress: Work Begins
    InProgress --> Completed: Work Finished
    InProgress --> NotStarted: Work Paused/Cancelled
    Completed --> [*]
    
    note right of NotStarted
        Item in backlog
        Not assigned to sprint
    end note
    
    note right of InProgress
        Item assigned to sprint
        Currently being worked on
    end note
    
    note right of Completed
        Item finished
        Tested and verified
    end note
```
