**Status**: ⏳ In Progress  
**Priority**: 🟠 High  
**Story Points**: 3  
**Created**: 2026-01-20  
**Updated**: 2026-01-20  
**Assigned Sprint**: Sprint 2

## Description

Implement security measures including user whitelisting and error handling including Joplin API availability checks.

## User Story

As a user, I want the bot to be secure and handle errors gracefully so that I can trust it with my Joplin notes and get helpful feedback when things go wrong.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Bot checks user ID against whitelist before processing
- [ ] Bot pings Joplin API before operations
- [ ] Bot shows appropriate messages when Joplin is unavailable
- [ ] Bot handles LLM API errors and timeouts
- [ ] Bot handles invalid responses gracefully
- [ ] Bot logs errors for debugging

## Business Value

Ensures the system is secure and reliable, protecting user data and providing good user experience during failures.

## Technical Requirements

- Whitelist based on Telegram user IDs
- API availability checks before operations
- Comprehensive error messages
- Logging for troubleshooting
- Graceful degradation when services unavailable

## Reference Documents

- requirement.md - Error Handling & Security section

## Technical References

- Function: check_whitelist()
- Function: ping_joplin_api()
- File: src/security_utils.py

## Dependencies

- FR-004: Telegram Bot Interface (integrates with bot)
- FR-005: Joplin REST API Client (ping functionality)

## Notes

Security is critical since the bot accesses personal Joplin data. Error handling improves reliability.
