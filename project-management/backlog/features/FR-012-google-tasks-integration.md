# Feature Request: FR-012 - Google Tasks Integration for Task Logging

**Status**: ✅ Completed
**Priority**: 🟡 Medium
**Story Points**: 8
**Created**: 2025-01-27
**Updated**: 2025-01-23
**Assigned Sprint**: Sprint 4  

## Description

Integrate with Google Tasks API to automatically create and manage tasks from Telegram bot interactions. Allow users to convert notes or decisions into actionable tasks in Google Tasks for better task management and follow-up.

## User Story

As a user managing multiple tasks, 
I want notes with action items automatically converted to Google Tasks, 
so that I can track and manage my to-dos across all my devices.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Google Tasks API integration configured
- [ ] OAuth2 authentication for Google Tasks
- [ ] Automatic task creation from bot decisions
- [ ] Task linking between Joplin notes and Google Tasks
- [ ] Task status synchronization
- [ ] Configuration for task list selection
- [ ] Error handling for API failures
- [ ] Privacy controls for task data

## Business Value

Enhances productivity by bridging note-taking with task management. Users can seamlessly convert insights into actionable items, improving follow-through on captured information.

## Technical Requirements

- Google Tasks API v1 integration
- OAuth2 flow for user authentication
- Async API calls to avoid blocking
- Task metadata storage in database
- Rate limiting and quota management
- Secure token storage

## Reference Documents

- Google Tasks API documentation
- Current logging and decision system
- User authentication patterns

## Technical References

- Google Tasks API: https://developers.google.com/tasks/api
- Authentication: OAuth2 flow
- Database: Extend logging_service for task links

## Dependencies

- Logging database implementation (FR-010)
- User authentication system

## Notes

This would allow users to automatically create tasks from AI-identified action items in their notes. For example, if a note contains "follow up with client next week", it could create a task in Google Tasks.

Integration should be optional and configurable per user.
