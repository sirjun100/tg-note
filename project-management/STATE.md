## How to Use (for AI)

1. **When user starts a process**: Set Process and Step in the table above. Add Context if relevant (e.g. sprint number, backlog item ID).
2. **When moving to next step**: Update Step. Optionally add a brief note in Context.
3. **When process completes**: Set Process to `(none)` and Step to `(none)`.
4. **Always read this file** when working in `project-management/` or when the user mentions release notes, backlog, sprint planning, or pre-commit.
