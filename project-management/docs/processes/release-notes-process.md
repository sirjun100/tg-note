# Release Notes Process

## Overview

Release notes document changes for **users and developers** at the root of the project in `RELEASE_NOTES.md`. One entry per merge to main (or push). Date-based versioning.

**Location**: `RELEASE_NOTES.md` (project root)

## When to Update

- **Each push/merge to main** — Add a new dated section
- **End of sprint** — Review and ensure all sprint changes are documented; run the draft script

## Release Note Structure

Each release section includes:

| Section | Content |
|---------|---------|
| **New Features** | Short title, short description, link to backlog (FR-XXX) |
| **Bug Fixes** | Short title, short description, link to backlog (BF-XXX) |
| **Breaking Changes** | If any; migration steps |
| **Migration Notes** | If any; upgrade instructions |

## Format

```markdown
## YYYY-MM-DD

### New Features
- **Title** — Short description. [FR-XXX](project-management/backlog/features/FR-XXX-*.md)

### Bug Fixes
- **Title** — Short description. [BF-XXX](project-management/backlog/bugs/BF-XXX-*.md)

### Breaking Changes
- (none this release)

### Migration Notes
- (none this release)
```

## Guidelines

- **Short titles** — One line, imperative mood
- **Short descriptions** — 1–2 sentences max
- **Link to backlog** — Use relative path to the backlog item file
- **Audience** — Write for both users (what changed) and developers (technical context when relevant)

## Semi-Automation

Run the draft generator before writing:

```bash
python scripts/generate_release_notes_draft.py
```

This parses recent commits for `BF-XXX` and `FR-XXX` patterns and outputs a draft. Copy into `RELEASE_NOTES.md` and edit for clarity.
