# Feature Request: [ID] - [Feature Title]

**Status**: ⭕ Not Started  
**Priority**: 🔴 Critical / 🟠 High / 🟡 Medium / 🟢 Low  
**Story Points**: [X] (Fibonacci: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13)  
**Created**: [YYYY-MM-DD]  
**Updated**: [YYYY-MM-DD]  
**Assigned Sprint**: [Sprint Number or "Backlog"]

## Description

[Clear description of the feature request. Explain what needs to be built and why.]

## User Story

As a [user type: e.g., "registered user", "admin", "mobile app user"], 
I want [functionality: e.g., "to filter search results by date"], 
so that [benefit: e.g., "I can quickly find recent items"].

**Tips**:
- Start with user role
- Use action verbs (filter, create, delete, view)
- Focus on value, not implementation
- Be specific about the benefit

**Examples**:
- As a registered user, I want to filter search results by date, so that I can quickly find recent items.
- As an admin, I want to export user data to CSV, so that I can generate reports.
- As a mobile app user, I want to save items offline, so that I can access them without internet.
