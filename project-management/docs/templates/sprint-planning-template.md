2. Fill in sprint header information
3. Add user stories from the product backlog
4. Break down stories into tasks
5. Estimate tasks and track progress
6. Save as: `sprints/sprint-[XX]-[sprint-name].md`

## Story Point Estimation Guide

### Fibonacci Sequence

Use Fibonacci sequence for story point estimation:
- **1 Point**: Trivial task, < 1 hour
- **2 Points**: Simple task, 1-4 hours
- **3 Points**: Small task, 4-8 hours
- **5 Points**: Medium task, 1-2 days
- **8 Points**: Large task, 2-3 days
- **13 Points**: Very large task, 3-5 days (should be broken down)

### Estimation Factors

Consider:
- **Complexity**: How complex is the task?
- **Uncertainty**: How much is unknown?
- **Effort**: How much work is required?
- **Risk**: What are the risks?

---

## Task Breakdown Guidelines

### Good Task Characteristics

- **Specific**: Clear what needs to be done
- **Actionable**: Can be started immediately
- **Testable**: Has clear completion criteria
- **Referenced**: Links to technical documents
- **Estimated**: Has story points assigned
- **Small**: Can be completed in 1-2 days (ideally)

### Technical References

Each task should reference:
- **Class/Method**: Specific code location
- **Document**: Relevant specification document
- **Section**: Specific section in document

**Format examples**:
- Class: `UserService`
- Method: `UserService.validateEmail()`
- File: `src/services/user_service.py`
- API Endpoint: `POST /api/v1/users`
- Database: `users` table

---

## Sprint Tracking

### Daily Standup Format

- What did I complete yesterday?
- What will I work on today?
- Are there any blockers?

### Sprint Burndown

Track daily progress:
- Story points completed
- Tasks completed
- Remaining work
- Velocity tracking

### Sprint Review

- Demo completed features
- Review acceptance criteria
- Gather feedback from stakeholders
- Update backlog based on feedback

### Sprint Retrospective

- What went well?
- What could be improved?
- Action items for next sprint
- Process improvements

---

## Status Values

### Story/Task Status
- ⭕ **Not Started**: Not yet begun
- ⏳ **In Progress**: Currently being worked on
- ✅ **Completed**: Finished and verified

### Priority Levels
- 🔴 **Critical**: Must be completed this sprint
- 🟠 **High**: Important, should be completed
- 🟡 **Medium**: Nice to have
- 🟢 **Low**: Can be deferred if needed

- Update burndown chart daily during sprint
- Review and refine tasks during sprint planning
- Break down large tasks (> 8 points) into smaller subtasks
- Update status regularly to reflect current progress
