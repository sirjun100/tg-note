# Bug Fix: [ID] - [Bug Description]

**Status**: ⭕ Not Started  
**Priority**: 🔴 Critical / 🟠 High / 🟡 Medium / 🟢 Low  
**Story Points**: [X] (Fibonacci: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13)  
**Created**: [YYYY-MM-DD]  
**Updated**: [YYYY-MM-DD]  
**Assigned Sprint**: [Sprint Number or "Backlog"]

## Description

[Clear, concise description of the bug. One or two sentences summarizing the issue.]

Example:
- User registration fails when email contains special characters
- Dashboard shows incorrect total count after filtering

## Steps to Reproduce

1. [Step 1 - specific action: e.g., "Navigate to Settings > Profile"]
2. [Step 2 - specific action: e.g., "Enter email: 'user+test@example.com'"]
3. [Step 3 - specific action: e.g., "Click 'Save' button"]
4. [Observed behavior - what happens: e.g., "Error message appears: 'Invalid email format'"]

**Tips**:
- Be specific and detailed
- Include exact values/inputs if relevant
- Number each step sequentially
- Include precondition if needed (e.g., "User must be logged in")
- Test the steps yourself to ensure they reproduce the bug
- Include environment details if relevant to reproduction

Example:
1. Navigate to Settings > Profile
2. Enter email: "user+test@example.com"
3. Click "Save"
4. Error message appears: "Invalid email format"

## Expected Behavior

[What should happen when following the steps above.]

Example:
- Email should be saved successfully with validation passing
- Success message should appear: "Profile updated"

## Actual Behavior

[What actually happens when following the steps above. Include error messages, crashes, incorrect behavior, etc.]

Example:
- Error message appears: "Invalid email format"
- Email is not saved
- User cannot proceed

## Environment

[Platform-specific environment details. Adapt this section to your application type.]

### For Web Applications:
- **Browser**: [Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.]
- **Browser Version**: [Version number]
- **OS**: [Windows, macOS, Linux]
- **OS Version**: [Version number]
- **Screen Resolution**: [if relevant]

### For Mobile Applications:
- **Device**: [Device model, e.g., iPhone 13, Pixel 6]
- **OS**: [iOS, Android]

## Screenshots/Logs

[If applicable, include screenshots, error logs, stack traces, or console output.]

**Format**:
- Use markdown image syntax: `![Description](path/to/image.png)`
- Use code blocks for logs:
  ```
  Error: Invalid email format
  Stack trace:
  at validateEmail() ...
  ```

## Technical Details

[Technical information about the bug. Include any relevant technical context, edge cases, or patterns observed.]

Examples:
- The email validation regex doesn't handle the '+' character
- Race condition when multiple users update the same record
- Missing null check causes NullPointerException

## Root Cause

[Analysis of the root cause. May be filled in after investigation.]

Example:
- Missing null check in `UserService.validateEmail()` method
- Email regex pattern doesn't include '+' character: `/^[a-z0-9._%+-]+@[a-z0-9.-]+\.[a-z]{2,}$/i`

## Solution

[Proposed or implemented solution. Include code changes, configuration updates, or workarounds.]

Example:
- Update email regex to include '+' character
- Add null check before validation
- Update unit tests to cover this case

## Reference Documents

- [Document Name 1] - [Section/Page]
- [Document Name 2] - [Section/Page]

Examples:
- API documentation - Validation rules section
- User guide - Registration section
- Architecture documentation - Authentication flow

## Technical References

[Links to specific code locations, classes, or files. Adapt format to your tech stack.]

**Format examples**:
- Class: `UserService`
- Method: `UserService.validateEmail()`
- File: `src/services/user_service.py`
