# Sprint 1: Foundation Templates

**Sprint Goal**: Establish core templates and documentation workflows for the backlog toolkit, including git commit templates and visual workflow diagrams.

**Duration**: 2026-01-01 - 2026-01-15 (2 weeks)  
**Team Velocity**: 10 points (initial sprint, target based on selected backlog items)  
**Sprint Planning Date**: 2026-01-01  
**Sprint Review Date**: 2026-01-15  
**Sprint Retrospective Date**: 2026-01-15

## Sprint Overview

**Focus Areas**:
- Complete git commit message template implementation
- Add Mermaid workflow diagrams to backlog management process
- Establish documentation standards and templates

**Key Deliverables**:
- Completed git commit message template (US-001)
- Mermaid workflow diagrams integrated into process documentation (US-002)
- Updated backlog management process document with visual workflows

**Dependencies**:
- None - both features are independent

**Risks & Blockers**:
- Mermaid.js rendering compatibility across different markdown viewers
- Ensuring diagrams accurately represent the workflow process

## User Stories

### Story 1: Add Git Commit Message Template - 5 Points

**User Story**: As a developer working on this project, I want a standardized git commit message template, so that all commits follow a consistent format that links to backlog items, clearly describes business value, and provides technical details for other developers.

### Story 2: Add Mermaid Workflow Diagrams for Backlog Management - 5 Points

**User Story**: As a team member (developer, product owner, or scrum master), I want visual workflow diagrams using Mermaid.js that show how feature requests and bug fixes flow from creation to sprint planning, so that I can quickly understand the process, identify where items are in the workflow, and ensure proper procedures are followed.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [x] Mermaid flowchart diagram created showing feature request workflow (creation → backlog → refinement → sprint planning)
- [x] Mermaid flowchart diagram created showing bug fix workflow (creation → backlog → immediate action/sprint planning)
- [x] Mermaid state diagram created showing status lifecycle (Not Started → In Progress → Completed)
- [x] Diagrams integrated into backlog management process document
- [x] Diagrams include decision points (e.g., critical bug vs. regular bug)
- [x] Diagrams include all key steps from the process document
- [x] Diagrams are properly formatted and render correctly in markdown viewers
- [x] Diagrams reference relevant sections of the process document
- [x] Example diagrams added to examples folder for reference

**Reference Documents**:
- Backlog Management Process: `backlog-toolkit/processes/backlog-management-process.md`
- Product Backlog Structure: `backlog-toolkit/processes/product-backlog-structure.md`
- Sprint Planning Template: `backlog-toolkit/templates/sprint-planning-template.md`

**Technical References**:
- Process document: `backlog-toolkit/processes/backlog-management-process.md`
- Examples folder: `backlog-toolkit/examples/`
- Mermaid.js documentation: https://mermaid.js.org/

## Story Point Estimation Guide

### Fibonacci Sequence

Use Fibonacci sequence for story point estimation:
- **1 Point**: Trivial task, < 1 hour
- **2 Points**: Simple task, 1-4 hours
- **3 Points**: Small task, 4-8 hours
- **5 Points**: Medium task, 1-2 days
- **8 Points**: Large task, 2-3 days
- **13 Points**: Very large task, 3-5 days (should be broken down)

## Notes

- Both stories are high priority and foundational for the backlog toolkit
- US-001 is already in progress with most acceptance criteria met
- US-002 needs implementation of diagrams into the process document
- Diagrams proposed in US-002 should be reviewed and refined before integration
- Test Mermaid.js rendering in GitHub, GitLab, VS Code, and other common viewers
