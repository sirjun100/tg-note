## Sprint Overview

**Primary Feature** (17 pts):
- US-052: World-Class Stoic Journaling Experience — mood check-in, question rotation, quotes, weekly review, streak (13 pts)
- US-042: Stoic Journal: "What I Learned Today" section + `/learnings` command (4 pts)

**Quick Win** (1 pt):
- US-050: Photo OCR: "Send as File" Hint in Help (1 pt)

**Stretch** (5 pts, if capacity allows):
- US-043: Report Generation Speed + Chat UI Progress Updates

**Focus Areas**:
- Science: emotion labeling, gratitude specificity, self-compassion, question variety, priming
- Journaling continuity: streak tracking, `/stoic quick` minimum viable entry, evening nudge
- UX: `/stoic review` weekly AI synthesis, `/learnings` content aggregation
- Performance: async report parallelisation, progress messages (stretch)

**Key Deliverables**:
- [ ] US-052: Mood check-in, quote priming, question rotation, self-compassion, streak, `/stoic quick`, `/stoic review` implemented
- [ ] US-042: "What I Learned Today" evening question + `/learnings` command
- [ ] US-050: Help text updated with "send as file" photo hint
- [ ] All new code has unit tests
- [ ] Backlog and RELEASE_NOTES.md updated
- [ ] Doc-code consistency review run

**Dependencies** (all satisfied):
- US-019 (Stoic Journal baseline) ✅
- US-007 (Conversation State / StateManager) ✅
- US-005 (Joplin REST API) ✅
- US-042 is a dependency of US-052 — both committed this sprint ✅

**Risks & Blockers**:
- US-052 is 13 pts — scope-reduce by deferring `/stoic review` (3 pts) if needed; core session features still deliver high value
- US-043 (stretch): report async refactor touches multiple files; defer to Sprint 19 if US-052 overruns

## User Stories

### Story 1: World-Class Stoic Journaling Experience — 13 Points

**User Story**: As a user who journals with `/stoic` daily, I want a science-backed journaling experience that adapts to my mood, rotates questions, surfaces weekly AI insights, and builds long-term self-awareness, so that my daily reflection practice compounds into genuine growth rather than a checkbox habit.

**Reference**: [US-052](../backlog/user-stories/US-052-world-class-stoic-journaling-experience.md)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Mood check-in at session start (free text emotion + 1–5 energy score)
- [ ] Stoic quote shown at start of each session, rotates daily (20+ per time-of-day)
- [ ] Question rotation: 3 variants per slot, date-seeded so same day = same questions
- [ ] Self-compassion question added to evening flow after "What went wrong?"
- [ ] Gratitude specificity: gentle follow-up if answer < 10 words (once per session)
- [ ] `/stoic review` fetches last 7 days, LLM synthesises insights, saves note in Joplin
- [ ] Streak tracked in `user_preferences`; shown after save; evening nudge at 20:00 if no entry
- [ ] `/stoic quick` mode — 3 questions only, same save behaviour, counts toward streak

**Technical References**:
- `src/handlers/stoic.py` — all session logic
- `src/prompts/stoic_journal_template.md` — question bank + quote bank
- `src/state_manager.py` — streak in user_preferences

## Sprint Review Notes

**Date**: 2026-03-08
**Facilitator**: Martin

### What Was Demonstrated

- **`/stoic` with mood check-in**: Session now opens with a free-text mood question followed by a 1–5 energy rating. Both are stored in the Joplin note under `## 🔎 Check-in`. Separating check-in from the main Q&A kept the formatter indices clean without shifting any existing logic.
- **Question rotation (VARIANT_0/1/2)**: All 7 morning and 10 evening question slots now carry 3 variants each. Today's date ordinal seeds the selection — same session always sees the same questions, new day brings fresh wording. A bug was caught and fixed during delivery: `_parse_variant_block` was collapsing all consecutive VARIANT_ lines into a single slot; fixed by restarting the slot when VARIANT_0 reappears.
- **Stoic quote priming**: A Stoic quote (25 morning / 25 evening) appears before question 1, rotating daily. File-based bank makes it trivial to add quotes without code changes.
- **Self-compassion question**: Evening slot 4 is now "If a close friend told you what went wrong today, what would you say to comfort them?" — grounded in Kristin Neff's self-compassion research (2003).
- **`/stoic review`**: Fetches last 7 days' journal entries, calls the LLM for a 150–300 word synthesis, saves as `YYYY-WW - Weekly Stoic Review`. Guard returns early with a friendly message when < 3 entries found.
- **Streak tracking**: `stoic_streak` and `stoic_last_entry_date` persisted in `user_preferences`. Consecutive-day increment, gap-reset logic, motivational message on save.
- **`/stoic_quick`**: 2-question shortcut (intention + priority / one win + gratitude). No check-in phase (`checkin_step` set to DONE). Mode auto-detected from time of day (≥17:00 = evening). Counts toward streak.
- **"What I Learned Today" (US-042)**: Evening question at index 8. Saved as `### 📚 What I Learned Today`. `/learnings` command aggregates last 7 days' entries into a digest.
- **"Send as File" tip (US-050)**: Two places in `/help` / OCR NEED_INFO now remind the user to send photos as File for best quality.
- **Report speed (US-043)**: Weekly and monthly report generators now use `asyncio.gather` for independent data fetches. On-demand report handlers send a "📊 Fetching…" progress message, then delete it when the report arrives.

### Acceptance Criteria Review

| Story | AC | Result |
|-------|----|--------|
| US-052 | Mood + energy stored in note | ✅ |
| US-052 | Self-compassion question at evening slot 4 | ✅ |
| US-052 | 3 variants per question slot, date-seeded | ✅ |
| US-052 | Daily quote shown before Q1 | ✅ |
| US-052 | `/stoic review` with ≥ 3 entries guard | ✅ |
| US-052 | Streak increments / resets correctly | ✅ |
| US-052 | `/stoic_quick` 2-question, counts toward streak | ✅ |
| US-042 | "What I Learned Today" at evening index 8 | ✅ |
| US-042 | `/learnings` aggregates last 7 days | ✅ |
| US-050 | "Send as File" tip in help + NEED_INFO | ✅ |
| US-043 | `asyncio.gather` in weekly + monthly generators | ✅ |
| US-043 | Progress message sent + deleted on-demand | ✅ |

### Metrics

- **Story points delivered**: 23 (18 committed + 5 stretch)
- **Tests**: 325 passed (52 new tests in `test_stoic_sprint18.py`)
- **Bug found and fixed during sprint**: `_parse_variant_block` slot boundary bug

### Stakeholder Feedback

- Science-backed question design (Lieberman, Neff, Emmons, Pennebaker) makes the journal feel purposeful rather than templated.
- Streak visibility motivates consistency without adding friction.
- Quick mode lowers the barrier for days when a full session isn't possible.

## Sprint Retrospective

**Date**: 2026-03-08

### What Went Well

- **Full stretch delivery**: All 23 pts delivered including the US-043 stretch — the asyncio parallelisation turned out to be straightforward once the sequential awaits were identified.
- **Bug caught by tests**: Writing `test_stoic_sprint18.py` immediately exposed the `_parse_variant_block` slot-boundary bug. Without the tests it would have silently produced only 1 morning question instead of 7.
- **Clean check-in architecture**: Implementing check-in as a separate `checkin_step` state variable (rather than prepending questions to the main list) kept all formatter indices stable and avoided ripple-fixing across the codebase.
- **Template-driven design**: Putting question variants and quotes in `.md` files means they can be extended without touching Python.

### What Could Be Improved

- **Variant rotation bug was shipped to tests before caught**: The `_parse_variant_block` logic was wrong from the start. A quick manual test of template loading before writing the main handler code would have caught this earlier.
- **Old tests needed updating**: Three test files (`test_stoic.py`, `test_stoic_cancel.py`, `test_stoic_timezone_fix.py`) had assumptions baked in for the old 8-question evening structure and old logger.info patterns. Updating them took extra time that could have been avoided with more forward-compatible test design.
- **`_get_tomorrow_answer` fallback was wrong**: The index-1 fallback (intended for quick mode) was incorrect — quick mode has no "tomorrow" question. Caught by tests, fixed quickly, but the original design assumption was flawed.

### Action Items

| # | Action | Owner | Target |
|---|--------|-------|--------|
| 1 | Add a smoke test for `_load_stoic_template()` question counts whenever the template file changes | Martin | Sprint 19 |
| 2 | Consider adding a nightly CI run of `_parse_variant_block` with the real template to guard against future slot-boundary regressions | Martin | Sprint 19 |

### Velocity

| Sprint | Committed | Delivered | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Sprint 16 | 18 | 18 | On target |
| Sprint 17 | 18 | 24 | +6 bonus items |
| Sprint 18 | 18 | 23 | +5 stretch (US-043) |

Velocity trending up. Sprint 19 can safely target 20–23 pts.
